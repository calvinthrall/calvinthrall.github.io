### The Atomizers: Multinational Firms and the Fragmentation of Global Economic Governance

<img style="float: center; padding: 50px;" src="assets/pinn_cartoon.png">

In the first decades following World War II, the world’s industrial powers believed that the global
economy should be regulated by institutions that are inclusive, cooperative, and multilateral. In
the 21st century, however, most global economic governance is conducted through ad hoc bilateral
agreements; this piecemeal approach reduces aggregate welfare, promotes inequality both across
and within states, and enables economic nationalism.

_The Atomizers_ provides a new explanation for the decline of multilateralism: multinational firms,
a minor economic force in the middle of the 20th century but a dominant one at its end, prefer
bilateral economic agreements over multilateral ones because the former provide firms with greater
benefits relative to their competitors. As firms expand abroad into new host markets, they form new
interest groups—which I call the _bilateral lobbies_—to petition their home government for greater
bilateral integration.

Using a wide range of novel data sources—including bilateral chambers of commerce, text data
from oral history interviews with thousands of U.S. diplomats, declassified diplomatic cables, and
subnational trade data from the USSR—this book demonstrates that, paradoxically, the globaliza-
tion of the firm led to the atomization of global economic governance.
