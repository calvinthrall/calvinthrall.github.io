### Bio

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/thrall_headshot_2022.JPG">
Hello and welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at <a href="https://polisci.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, where I am also associated with the <a href="https://www.siwps.org/programs/the-politics-and-global-economy-page-lab/">Politics and the Global Economy (PaGE) Lab</a> at the Saltzman Institute. <br>
<br>
I study the politics of business, diplomacy, and global governance. My book project, titled <i>Piecemeal Diplomacy: Globalization, Interest Groups, and the Atomization of Foreign Policy</i>, examines the role of organized business in driving the global shift towards bilateral, <i>ad hoc</i> global governance over the last several decades. Some of my work has been published in <i>International Organization</i>, <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, and <i>International Studies Quarterly</i>. 
<br><br>
Prior to joining Columbia, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University's <a href="https://niehaus.princeton.edu/">Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance</a>. I received my PhD from the Department of Government at The University of Texas at Austin.<br><br>
